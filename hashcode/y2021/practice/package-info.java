/**
 * Even more pizza
 * Hash Code practice problem
 * Introduction
 * Isn't it fun to share pizza with friends? But, sometimes you just don't have enough time to choose
 * what pizza to order. Wouldn't it be nice if someone else chose for you?
 * In an imaginary world…
 * © Google 2021, All rights reserved.
 * This is a practice problem which allows you to get familiar with the Hash Code Judge System
 * and problem format before the Online Qualications. See g.co/hashcode/schedule for more
 * information.
 * Problem description
 * Task
 * Help the imaginary pizzeria choose the pizzas to deliver to Hash Code teams. And since we want
 * everyone to enjoy their food, let's try to deliver to each team, as many dierent ingredients as we
 * can.
 * Pizza
 * Expecting many hungry customers, the pizzeria has already prepared some pizzas with dierent
 * ingredients. Each pizza can be delivered to at most one team. There can be multiple pizzas with
 * the exact same set of ingredients.
 * Teams
 * Teams of 2, 3, or 4 people all ordered pizzas. Each team ordered one pizza per team member, but
 * did not specify what ingredients to put on the pizzas. The pizzeria might not deliver to a team (no
 * pizzas are sent to that team). However, if the order is delivered, exactly one pizza should be
 * available per person. For example, it is an error to send 3 pizzas to a 4-person team.
 * Goal
 * Given the description of the pizzas available, and the number of teams of 2, 3, or 4 people that
 * have ordered, decide which pizzas to send to each of the teams. The goal is to maximize, per
 * team, the number of dierent ingredients used in all their pizzas.

 * For example, there are 5 pizzas available in the pizzeria:
 * Pizza 0 Pizza 1 Pizza 2 Pizza 3 Pizza 4
 * Pizza 0: onion, pepper, olive
 * Pizza 1: mushroom, tomato, basil
 * Pizza 2: chicken, mushroom, pepper
 * Pizza 3: tomato, mushroom, basil
 * Pizza 4: chicken, basil
 * Note that Pizzas 1 and 3 have the same ingredients, even though they are mentioned in
 * dierent order.
 * Input data set
 * The input data is provided as a data set le - a plain text le containing exclusively ASCII
 * characters with lines terminated with a single ‘\n’ character (UNIX-style line endings).
 * File format
 * The rst line of the input le contains the following integer numbers separated by single spaces:
 * ● M ( 1 ≤ M ≤ 100 000 ) - the number of pizzas available in the pizzeria
 * ● T2
 * ( 0 ≤ T 0 000 ) - the number of 2-person teams 2 ≤ 5
 * ● T3 ( 0 ≤ T 0 000 ) - the number of 3-person teams 3 ≤ 5
 * ● T4
 * ( 0 ≤ T 0 000 ) - the number of 4-person teams 4 ≤ 5
 * The next M lines describe the pizzas available. Each line contains (space separated):
 * ● an integer I ( 1 ≤ I ≤ 10 000 ) - the number of ingredients,
 * ● followed by the list of I ingredients - Each ingredient consists of lowercase ASCII leers
 * and dash (-) characters, and its length can be between 1 and 20 characters in total. Each
 * ingredient in a pizza is dierent, but the same ingredient can appear on dierent pizzas.
 * Example
 * © Google 2021, All rights reserved.
 * For example, if we deliver to a 3-person team Pizzas 0, 2 and 3, there will be 7 dierent
 * ingredients (9 ingredients in total, but pepper and mushroom occur twice):
 * ● Pizza 0
 * ○ onion
 * ○ pepper
 * ○ olive
 * ● Pizza 2:
 * ○ chicken
 * ○ mushroom
 * ○ pepper (is already on Pizza 0)
 * ● Pizza 3:
 * ○ tomato
 * ○ mushroom (is already on Pizza 2)
 * ○ basil
 * Input file Description
 * 5 1 2 1
 * 3 onion pepper olive
 * 3 mushroom tomato basil
 * 3 chicken mushroom pepper
 * 3 tomato mushroom basil
 * 2 chicken basil
 * 5 pizzas, 1 team of two, 2 teams of three, and 1 team of four
 * Pizza 0 has the given 3 ingredients
 * Pizza 1 has the given 3 ingredients
 * Pizza 2 has the given 3 ingredients
 * Pizza 3 has the given 3 ingredients
 * Pizza 4 has the given 2 ingredients
 * Submissions
 * File format
 * The rst line of the submission le contains a number D ( 1 ≤ D ≤ T ), representing the 2 + T3 + T4
 * number of pizza deliveries.
 * The following D lines contain descriptions of each delivery. Each line contains the following
 * integer numbers separated by single spaces:
 * ● L ( 2 ≤ L ≤ 4 ) - the number of people in the team
 * ● followed by the list of pizzas, P1 … PL - the space separated indexes of the pizzas delivered
 * to that team
 * Even though it’s nice to deliver pizzas to all teams, it is allowed to make fewer deliveries than the
 * number of teams. However, making more deliveries than the number of teams is an error. It is
 * also an error to make more deliveries to 2, 3 or 4-person teams than the corresponding number
 * of teams provided in the input le: the number of lines with L=N, should not be greater than TN
 * .
 * Example
 * Validation
 * In order for the submission to be accepted:
 * ● each pizza must be pa of at most one order,
 * ● for all N-person teams, either nobody or everybody receives a pizza,
 * ● there are TN or less deliveries to teams of N people.
 * Scoring
 * For each delivery, the delivery score is the square of the total number of dierent ingredients of
 * all the pizzas in the delivery. The total score is the sum of the scores for all deliveries.

 * Submission file Description
 * 2
 * 2 1 4
 * 3 0 2 3
 * Pizzas are delivered to 2 teams
 * A 2-person team will receive Pizza 1 and Pizza 4
 * A 3-person team will receive Pizza 0, Pizza 2 and Pizza 3
 * For example, with the example input le and the example submission le above, there are
 * - 4 ingredients delivered to the two-person team (mushroom, tomato, basil, chicken). The
 * score for that team is 4
 * 2 = 16
 * - 7 ingredients delivered to the tree-person team. The score for that team is 7
 * 2= 49.
 * - (The score is 0 for the two teams that didn't have their order delivered)
 * The total score is 16 + 49 = 65.
 * Note that there are multiple data sets representing separate instances of the problem. The
 * nal score for your team will be the sum of your best scores for the individual data sets.
